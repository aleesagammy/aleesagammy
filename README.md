## hi hello and welcome 
### about me
I'm Alisa. I stand on the shoulders of giants but I am very medium sized.   
I graduated in 2023 with an Undergraduate Honors degree in Computing and Cognitive Science from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario (Canada).   
This has proved to pull me in many directions at once resulting in frequent near-dismemberment. I have experience in compsci, cognitive psych, and a considerable amount of philosophy.   
I am currently working as a Technical Account Manager, responsible for implementation of my company's software for enterprise clients. I adore talking to people. 10/10 would recommend. I am like a psychotherapist but only about tech issues.  
However, I am bored and really yearning to dive into the eternal confusion that is working with tech again. Aiming for DevOps and hopefully if I miss I'll still land among the stars (QA Eng?).   
One day I am going to go back to univertisy for Philosophy, and leave everything else behind. It will be like  pilgrimage home after a long adventure to Mordor and back. But for now, my path leads only to Mordor and there's no turning back until I get what I set out to do.
